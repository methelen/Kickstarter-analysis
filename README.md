# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analyze outcome of play fundraising campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
To visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis was done with a set of categorical data that was then filtered to show theater/plays
for a more in depth visualization. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Filtering data to only include theater to compare only those campaigns. Providing a breakdown
of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on the time of year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Breaking down the outcomes based on the size of the campaign goals. Creating dollar ranges
and separating out the successful, failed, and canceled campaigns only relating to plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Possible difficulties encountered in extracting the subcategorical data 
if formatting was off. A few struggles in the 'Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals' were 
encountered with multiple COUNTIF functions.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Launching a campaign in May will increase probability of a successful campaign. 
Failed campaigns account for roughly one third of the overall campaigns launched.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
'Outcomes Based on Goals' shows that the most successful campaigns had goals that were $49,999
and lower, and between $35,000 to $44,999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are some outliers, this could be considered a limited sample size, and there may be some
redundancy because some events are repetitive. Also, I would argue that location likely plays a
large part in successful campaigns, being in London vs. Minneapolis for example may skew the
data when considering starting a campaign

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A filter to provide only campaigns in a particular country. A chart of how long campaigns
have lasted from start to completion filtered by plays and by country. A graph to show if 
the more backers (or average donation) is correlated to length of campaign.
